# README

This is where I keep my notes on Git, as well as links to useful guides, tutorial, references, etc.

## My Stuff

My notes on working through [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) are [here](pro-git.md).

My notes on how to use git while on ssh are [here](git-server.md).

## Other People's Stuff

This [git branching game](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/) was very useful.

A very nice one-page [cheat sheet](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf).
